# Superchain Starter Kit: CrossChainMultisend

> Generated from [superchain-starter](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-starter). See the original repository for a more detailed development guide.

Example Superchain app (contract + frontend) that uses interop to send and withdraw ETH between chains. For hackathon purposes we use it to send ETH between chains and stake it in a yield farm.

## Demo Video

Check out our demo video to see the project in action: It has a simple UI to deposit ETH and stake it in a yield farm. It also has the deployed address of the contract on the devnet 0 and 1 chain.

## üîó Contracts

## Smart Contracts

### CrossChainMultisend.sol

The main contract that handles cross-chain ETH transfers and interactions with yield farms.

Key features:
- Send ETH between chains using the Superchain native bridge
- Track user balances across different chains
- Interact with yield farms on destination chains
- Withdraw ETH and earned yield back to the source chain

### SuperSimpleETHYieldFarm.sol (This is the contract we use in the hackathon and is deployed on the devnet 1 chains)

A simple yield farm contract that:
- Accepts ETH deposits
- Calculates and distributes yield based on a fixed APY
- Allows users to withdraw their staked ETH plus earned rewards
- Returns the reward amount when withdrawing

### SuperSimpleYieldFarmWithRewards.sol 

An enhanced version of the yield farm that:
- Explicitly returns reward amounts from functions
- Includes proper event emissions
- Maintains the same core yield calculation logic

### yieldFarm.sol

A contract that fetches and aggregates yield information from farms across different chains:
- Communicates with yield farms on various chains
- Stores and updates yield rates
- Provides a unified interface to query yield information
- Uses cross-chain messaging to update yield information

## How It Works

1. **Deposit Flow**:
   - User deposits ETH on Chain A
   - ETH is bridged to Chain B
   - On Chain B, the ETH is deposited into a yield farm

2. **Withdrawal Flow**:
   - User initiates a withdrawal from Chain A
   - The system withdraws ETH + earned yield from the farm on Chain B
   - ETH is bridged back to Chain A and returned to the user

3. **Yield Tracking**:
   - The yieldFetcher contract periodically queries yield rates from farms
   - Yield information is stored and made available across chains
   - Users can compare yields before deciding where to stake

## Technical Details

- Uses the Superchain WETH contract for cross-chain ETH transfers
- Leverages the L2-to-L2 Cross Domain Messenger for cross-chain communication
- Implements a simple APY-based yield calculation mechanism
- Tracks user balances across multiple chains

## üéØ Patterns

### 1. Contract deployed on same address on multiple chains

The CrossChainMultisend contract is designed to be deployed at the same address on all chains. This allows the contract to:

- "Trust" that the send message was emitted as a side effect of a specific sequence of events
- Process cross-chain messages from itself on other chains
- Maintain consistent behavior across the Superchain

```solidity
      CrossDomainMessageLib.requireCrossDomainCallback();

      ...

      function requireCrossDomainCallback() internal view {
        requireCallerIsCrossDomainMessenger();

        if (
            IL2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger(PredeployAddresses.L2_TO_L2_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER).crossDomainMessageSender()
                != address(this)
        ) revert InvalidCrossDomainSender();
    }
```

The above `CrossDomainMessageLib.requireCrossDomainCallback()` performs two checks

1. That the msg.sender is L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger
2. That the message being sent was originally emitted on the source chain by the same contract address

Without the second check, it will be possible for ANY address on the source chain to send the message. This is undesirable because now there is no guarantee that the message was generated as a result of someone calling `CrossChainMultisend.send`

### 2. Returning msgHash from functions that emit cross domain messages

The contract captures the msgHash from SuperchainWETH's sendETH call and passes it to the destination chain. This enables:

- Verification that the ETH bridge operation completed successfully
- Reliable cross-chain message dependency tracking

This is a pattern for composing cross domain messages. Functions that emit a cross domain message (such as `SuperchainWeth.sendEth`) should return the message hash so that other contracts can consume / depend on it.

This "returning msgHash pattern" is also used in the `CrossChainMultisend.sol`, making it possible for a different contract to compose on this.

```solidity
function send(uint256 _destinationChainId, Send[] calldata _sends) public payable returns (bytes32)
```

### 3. Dependent cross-chain messages

The contract implements a pattern for handling dependent cross-chain messages:

1. First message (ETH bridging) must complete successfully
2. Second message (ETH distribution) verifies the first message's success, otherwise reverts
3. Auto-relayer handles the dependency by waiting for the first message before processing the second

```solidity
CrossDomainMessageLib.requireMessageSuccess(_sendWethMsgHash);
```

The above check calls the L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.successfulMessages mapping to check that the message corresponding to msgHash was correctly relayed already.

While you can revert using any custom error, it is recommended that such cases emit

```solidity
error RequiredMessageNotSuccessful(bytes32 msgHash)
```

(which [`CrossDomainMessageLib.requireMessageSuccess`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/interop-lib/blob/main/src/libraries/CrossDomainMessageLib.sol) does under the hood)

This allows indexers / relayers to realize dependencies between messages, and recognize that a failed relayed message should be retried once the dependent message succeeds at some point in the future.

### 4. Using SuperchainWETH for cross-chain ETH transfers

The contract leverages SuperchainWETH to handle cross-chain ETH transfers:

- Automatically wraps and unwraps ETH as needed
- Provides reliable message hashes for tracking transfers
- Maintains ETH value consistency across chains

The high level flow is:

#### Source chain

`function sendETH(address _to, uint256 _chainId) external payable returns (bytes32 msgHash_);`

1. converts ETH to SuperchainWETH
2. sends SuperchainWETH (which follows SuperchainERC20 standard) using a crossdomain message

#### Destination chain

`function relayETH(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) external;`

1. relays the SuperchainWETH to the destination chain
2. converts the SuperchainWETH to ETH

## üöÄ Getting started

### Prerequisites: Foundry & Node

Follow [this guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install Foundry

### 1. Create a new repository using this template:

Click the "Use this template" button above on GitHub, or [generate directly](https://github.com/new?template_name=superchain-starter&template_owner=ethereum-optimism)

### 2. Clone your new repository

```bash
git clone <your-new-repository-url>
cd superchain-starter-multisend
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

### 4. Get started

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command will:

- Start a local Superchain network (1 L1 chain and 2 L2 chains) using [supersim](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim)
- Launch the frontend development server at (http://localhost:5173)
- Deploy the smart contracts to your local network

Start building on the Superchain!

## Security notice

This contract is not production ready. For one, the contract does not consider the case when the dispersal fails on the destination chain

1.  if one of the recipient is a contract that has a reverting `receive()` handler
2.  `relay(...)` call will revert, meaning none of the recipients will be able to receive the dispersal

One unimplemented mitigation is to add a withdrawal flow for any failed recipients such that one recipient's failure to receive doesn't prevent the others
